# Twist

  For this project I collaborated with Ryan Smith, John Green, Justin Zamecnik and Michael Siem.
  
  The Main learning objectives for this project were to collaborate with a team to create an application for use in the TWIST program and also to learn how web technologies such as GitHub, Turbo360 and methods of programming fit together to create a product.
  
  In this project I contributed mostly through designing the layout of the site and implementing CRUD.
  
  My group had a few challenges with this project. The first issue was communication. We needed to better relay information to group members. We worked through this by reviewing changes with each other. Another challenge was learning how to use mustache. I hadn't previously used it in other projects and needed to learn it for this one. I looked up some guides on how it worked and got through this issue quickly.
  
  The site needs to have needs to have functionality to create a schedule for the program and to link objects like presenters and topics together.
  
  IF I had to start over the main thing I would change is starting with better communication. We would need to layout the project more clearly so that everyone knew what they needed to do. I would also try to focus on understanding the code that I'm implementing. There were many times where I would put in code and not completely understand what it did. These are some issues I'm going to be working on in the future.
